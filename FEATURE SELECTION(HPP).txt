Ridge Regression with Feature Selection and Parameter Tuning

This script loads a dataset of housing prices and uses Ridge regression to predict house prices. It performs feature selection using Lasso regression and parameter tuning using GridSearchCV.


Prerequisites

pandas
numpy
seaborn
scikit-learn


Dataset

The dataset used in this script is the kc_house_data.csv file which contains information about housing prices in King County, USA.


Usage

Ensure that the dataset is located in the same directory as the script.
Run the script.


Procedure

Load the dataset using pandas.
Define the features and target variable.
Check for missing values and outliers.
Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Scale the data using StandardScaler.
Perform feature selection using Lasso regression.
Perform parameter tuning using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation.
Fit the Ridge regression model with the best parameters.
Evaluate performance on the test set using mean squared error and R2 score.
Create a dataframe to store the accuracy of the models.
Sort the models by accuracy in descending order and set the index to Model No.
Print the table.


Outputs

The script outputs a table with the accuracy of the Ridge regression model. The accuracy is measured using R2 score and is shown as a percentage.
